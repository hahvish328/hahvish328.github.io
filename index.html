<h1 style="color: white;"> Every Ferrari Fan is depressed </h1>
<p style="color: white;"> There's a cycle of depression that every Ferrari fan goes through because Ferrari keeps messing up the strategy. </p>
<p style="color: white;"> The cycle goes from "WE ARE SO BACK" to "kill me" to "WE ARE SO BACK" to "kill me" and so on and so forth. </p>

<p style="color: white;"> Every Ferrari Fan looks <strong>EXACTLY</strong> like this. We are all depressed. At this point I think Ferrari is hiring race engineers with mental issues so they can meet their DEI goals.</p>
<h2 style="color: white;"> Most Ferrari fans are fairly short, although I appear to be an exception. </h1>
<p style="color: white;"> Brandon Chen is a Ferrari fan and as you can probably see, he is quite short. He is so short that if you have bad eyesight, you'll struggle to see him. Legend says that he was able to ride an ant like a horse. Brandon is the one Ferrari fan that isn't depressed. </p>
