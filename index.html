     <h1>Why the 2018 Honda Civic LX is the best thing produced by humans</h1>

    <main>
        <h3>It's fun</h3>
        <p>As the proud owner of a 2018 Honda Civic LX, the thing is fun to drive. It's got 158 horsepower, which isn't much. However, it's lighter than a BMW M3 by over a THOUSAND POUNDS. That means 0-60 miles an hour still comes in under seven seconds. Not only is it fast in a straight line, it takes corners like a beast. The low weight and excellent suspension geometry make the car handle like it's on rails. The transversely mounted naturally aspirated 4 cylinder engine with VTEC means that the car is front wheel drive, which makes it excellent in the snow, rain, or any bad weather. It doesn't understeer much either because of the 4-corner multilink suspension. Remember, this car is the basis of the Honda Civic Type R, which was the fastest production front wheel drive car around the Nürburgring Nordschleife for quite some time.</p>

        <h3>It's small</h3>
        <p>For my entire life, I've always lived in or around large, urban cities. The Civic is small enough that street parking or compact spots aren't an issue. Oh, and you know those stupid right turn lanes where they're basically the width of a bike lane? The Civic is small enough to fit in those. However, you don't lose much space. I fit perfectly fine in the front. The back is a tight squeeze but that's mainly because 90 percent of my height is in my legs. The trunk is also large enough to carry your entire IKEA haul. This is mainly because of the short hood since the engine is transversely mounted. That means more of the length can be used for passenger or cargo space.</p>

        <h3>It's reliable</h3>
        <p>Do you like waking up in the morning to find that your car's dashboard is lit up like a Christmas tree? No? Well neither do I. Yes, a used Audi S5 is more fun, and yes, a used Fiat 500 is better in small spaces, but the Civic shines brightest in its reliabilty. Sure, it has a CVT, but it's a pretty bulletproof one. There's also a manual option which is going to be even more reliable. The K20C2 engine in the Civic is known as one of the most reliable engines every produced because of its simplicity. Four cylinders, no forced induction, no electronic throttle, everything is mechanical. Even then, it still gets on average 40 miles per gallon. Sure, a Toyota Corolla may be just as reliable, but I'm  pretty sure watching paint dry is more fun than driving a Corolla. A three-toed sloth is faster than a Corolla. Sure, the legendary third generation Toyota 4Runner is probably more reliable than a Civic while being fun in its own way, but good luck parking it without a parking spot the size of The Netherlands. In the seven years of my mom and I owning our Civic, it's only left us stranded once. That wasn't even the car's fault either, my mom just left the headlights on and killed the battery. "bUt wHaT aBoUt ThE B58 BmWs???" you say. If you buy a B58 BMW, the engine might be fairly solid, but everything else is going to break. For some reason, the Germans think that sugar is an appropriate material to construct an electrical system out of. Chances are if something goes wrong in that BMW, it's gonna be the Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft module and cost four thousand dollars to fix because it's a dealer-only job. Because of how simple the Civic is, you can fix it at home with a simple set of hand tools and a YouTube tutorial. Actually, you might also need DuoLingo or Google Translate as well because the only service manual I was able to find for the car was entirely in Japanese.</p>
